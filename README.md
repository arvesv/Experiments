# Experiment Reposotory

My playground for testing/learning stuff

## The things I have tested

- [x]  Using SSH to access remote hosts from a [Github Actions script](.github/workflows/remotessh.yml) 

- [x]  Multi architecture Docker builds (arm64 and amdx64) in a [GitHub Actions script](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml)

- [x] Test GitHub releases, Docker build on Git tags, what should the latest point to. [Find a methodology](docs/releasestags.md)
